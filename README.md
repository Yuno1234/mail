## Description
This is single page web application enables users to send and receive emails, as well as view, reply, and archive them. This was the first time I created an app using Django and JavaScript. Asynchronously sending and retrieving data added complexity to the project, along with more manipulation with the DOM. This was a valuable learning experience for me to gain an understanding of how modern single-page applications are typically designed.
